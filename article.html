		<img src="be-your-own-teacher.JPG" alt="some issue"/>
		<p>Self-learning is the modern form of learning. Not that it has replaced traditional, instructional learning, but it has supplemented it and with some great results. Self-directed learning has been proven to be effective, convenient, and fast, thanks to the rise of the internet. Nowadays, you can learn how to do almost anything through a simple Google search, by watching a YouTube tutorial, and by simply reading instruction manuals. Self-learning is the new form of learning that is equipping people with skills that are relevant to their daily activities. However, this can be a challenging form of learning even for the brightest students, since it requires lots of discipline.</p>
